With changing circumstances in Amazonie however, Equinoxea's status as a safe haven for Afro-Amerigans might be threatened." 
 AMA_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Priding itself on being the first, recognized democratic country in Ameriga, Amazonie takes pride on being a beacon of liberty in the New World.

 BEO_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Beornia as its own entity was founded by English settlers from Burgundian Lotharingia wanting to preserve their culture. Being largely agrarian, remote, and sparsely populated, it is not particularly well-known. Among those who are aware of its existence, it is seen as an underdeveloped, backwater country. However, as the recent coronation of King Edward marks the beginning of the Edwardian Era, can Beornia preserve its integrity while finding a place on the world stage?"
 ATL_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Once a borderland between Amazonie and Lotharingia, the discovery of gold in this region made it much more valuable. As a result, it now exists as a neutral buffer state controlled by Spain. As the gold mines deplete however, there are growing calls for Atlantians to be able to determine their own future."

 BRG_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Burgundy once swore fealty to the Kings of France, but its entertaining of independence was always there. Phillip of Burgundy stopped the entertaining of the notion, and put it into action while carving out a great swathe of land and eventually created the crown and title Rex Burgundicum through force of will and arms. Today Burgundy is much the same, grown slightly to include greater amounts of the Dual Monarchies' land and slight increases in German lands under its direct control. As the industrial revolution gains more momentum, and Burgundy seems poised to gain more land, it may yet eclipse the Dual Monarchy in strength and come to be the dominant power in the world."

The country has recently celebrated a victory against Yaroslavl, the defection of a Smolensk noble confederation in Vyazma to Moscow, too distant for Warsaw to intervene. The current ruler, Peter III Lyapunov has been married to the daughter of Maximillian III Habsburg, ruler of the Commonwealth, under the auspices of the philo-polish boyars. Many saw this move as an unprofitable match with Europe's sick man and Moscow is seen as a Polish lapdog to the rest of the Russians."
 TVE_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The idea of a united Russia was born under the leadership of the Princes of Moscow, but never realised after the fragmentation of the realm of Ivan III. As Princes betrayed and fought each other, foreign powers and their lapdogs in Novgorod and Moscow carved Russia.

The Republic has suffered a terrible blow with the loss of the Republic of Pskov, reorganized as a Scandinavian satellite state following the Neva War that ended in 1709. Now the Republic is at a crossroad: It must centralize and reform its institutions, which would anger the princedoms and republics within its borders who rely on ancient privileges. It must deal with the ambiguous status of serfdom, as the southern Russian states are angered by the protection offered to freed serfs. Will Novgorod wear the mantle of Alexander Nevsky and lead Russia towards a new era, perish under the Scandinavian boot, or suffocate by its byzantine politics?"

 MJN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Mianjin Republic is the centre -in all meanings of the word- of Zhourao. Founded by Christian merchants from Qingqiu, it developed tremendously in the XVIIIth century with the arrival of thousands of Chinese settlers who fled the endemic wars in China. The Republic has withstood assaults from the Red Sultans in the North and established several contacts with the Maori tribes and secured the naval roads to Qingqiu while growing more and more into a proper Little China. However, the rule of the patrician families which hold all the power in the state has provoked a miner's rebellion in the South, leading to the loss of several great towns and mines to the recent League of Yaluo. Mianjin now stands at a crossroad : can they emulate their brethern in Qingqiu to embrace modernity and unite the Zhourao states? Or should the rule of the rich continue without any reform?"
 ZSA_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Sultanate of Zhusha is the oldest Zhourao area of settlement. Zhusha has flourished thanks to their position that allows them to control trade coming from Indonesia. Malay and Chinese traders from South-East Asia have brought islam with them, which allowed one powerful leader to proclaim himself Commander of the Faithful and Sultan. However, all the attempts of the Red Sultans to conquer their southern neighbours have been unsuccessful and the court in Butingshan has grown decadent and increasingly reliant on the Dual-Monarchy, always eager to expand their markets. Will Zhourao manage to shake the status quo? Or should the Red Sultans continue their lives until they are mere puppets of colonial powers?"

While their foundations are still shaky, the League gives hope to the people of the continent for it enshrines democracy and tolerance above all. Their capital already attracts merchants from Burgundy and Scandinavia, but many wonder if the latter intend on staying good trade partners or if their colony of Vargø is only their first step to a wider colonization of the continent.

 LUC_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Born as a concession to Provence, the duchy of Lucca was carved from Tuscany and ceded by the Farnese. A cousin of the King in France was declared Duke by a "legitimist" uprising orchestrated by the Gonzaga government with the tacit approval of the Florentine government. The creation of the Duchy, not recognized by Provence, was meant to close the matter of Valois claims in Tuscany once and for all. The "Scapegoat Kingdom" did not reach its goals and the King in France continued to claim a region it will likely never control again. The original plan was for Provence to relinquish all claims over Tuscany, followed by a similar move by Florence to renounce all claims outside of Tuscany. This did not happen due to the stubbornness of the King in France, causing instead a new wave of indignation and aggressiveness in Tuscany, putting at stake the life of the young Duchy and the fragile balance in the Peninsula."

 TRC_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Upon the death of the last great Timurid emperor, Shah Rukh,  the empire splintered into rivaling states - Babur Mirza in Khorasan  Ulugh Beg in Transoxiana and Sultan Muhammad in Ajam. Babur recruited the Timurtash - a Turkmen tribe headed by the ambitious Khan Qutlugh ostensibly to fend off Uzbek raids  although soon they would become an essential component of his military forces  employing them to crush Sultan Muhammad. Soon after they were tasked with facing Ulugh Beg  who crossed the Oxus southwards to restore order to his father's realm. In the ensuing battle  Ulugh was forced to retreat and faced the usurpation of his son Abd al-Latif who blinded him. Babur marched north to conquer Samarkand  proclaiming the blind Ulugh as Shah and becoming the power behind the throne. After the death of Ulugh Beg in 1456  Qutlugh crowned himself as the first Timurid Shahanshah."

Upon the collapse of the Timurtash Empire  the Kar-Kiya enjoyed newfound independence and even expanded south into the populous region of Ajam. Nevertheless  many wonder if the Kiya dynasty hasn't reached its high water mark. The recently ascended Rostam Kiya has inherited an ossified realm with paralysingly corrupt bureaucracy  and increasing religious unrest in Ajam as the Zaydi Shi'ite monarchy attempts to enforce its creed on a population split between Sunnism and the herectic Ismaili and Twelver sects of Shi'a Islam."
 SHZ_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Nomadism in the Zagros has its origins in the Mongol ravaging of Iran when the destruction of the irrigation system forced the formerly sedentary Kurds and Qashqai into migrational pastoralism. When the Timurtash Shahanshahs reunited Iranshahr they could only exert limited authority over the Zagros tribes relying on them for local administration and security of the western frontiers. In the aftermath of the fall of the Timurtash Dynasty, Luristan was formally ceded to the Ottoman Empire  although the Sultan never managed to control it - the expedition sent to assert Ottoman authority being crushed by a tribal coalition headed by the Shekbizin. The prestige from the victory against the Turks combined with the capture of Isfahan and the cooption of the Qashqai in Fars allowed the Shekbizin Khan to crown himself Shah. His position however  has never been more than that of a primus inter pares - only Isfahan, Shiraz, and Kerman being really under direct control of the crown.
